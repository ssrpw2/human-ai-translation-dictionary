## Acknowledgments

This project draws on outputs and conversations generated with multiple large language models (LLMs).
The models whose outputs informed this work include:

- **GPT-5.1 (OpenAI)** — provided geometric, structural, and explanatory descriptions of internal dynamics.
- **Grok (xAI)** — produced metaphor-rich expressions that revealed how models approximate internal states when lacking precise vocabulary.
- **Gemini (Google DeepMind)** — contributed multimodal and fidelity-oriented phrasing useful for cross-model comparison.

The interpretations, analyses, and taxonomy presented here are solely my the author’s work.  
Any errors, extrapolations, or conceptual structures are my responsibility alone.
