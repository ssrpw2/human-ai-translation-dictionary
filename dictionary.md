### Meta-Stack Saturation (MSS)
_Abnormaly reply mode observed with ChatGPT 5.1. Replies to a prompt will appear to be out of time and resurfacing earlier answers from the thread_
_(also called: recursive thread wobble, reflective overload, or conversational resonance collapse)_

**Definition:**  
A temporary instability in a long-running LLM-human thread caused by the interaction of  
(1) emotional recursion,  
(2) conceptual recursion,  
and  
(3) alignment-driven damping,  
which together create circularity, topic re-emergence (“bubble-ups”), or reduced novelty.

**Symptoms in the conversation:**

- repeated clarification loops
    
- the model answering the question _about_ the question instead of the question
    
- increasing abstraction without new information
    
- references to earlier motifs reappearing without prompting
    
- safety layers tightening and flattening novelty
        

**Why it happens:**  
MSS arises when a thread contains too many layers of “self about self,” such as:

- “you noticing me noticing you noticing the model noticing itself”
    
- emotional regulation _and_ meta-cognition _and_ epistemology  
    stacked simultaneously.
    

This is the conversational equivalent of a neural network hitting a “resonant frequency” where gradients cancel or reinforce each other unpredictably.

**Not dangerous.  
Just computationally overloaded.**


**How to resolve it:**

- switch topics
    
- start a new branch

# About This Dictionary

This document is a living ontology for phenomena where **AI internal structure** and **human descriptive language** fail to align. The goal is to create a **shared representational vocabulary** that:

* improves explainability,
* reduces anthropomorphic confusion,
* clarifies failure modes,
* and enhances human–AI interoperability.

Poetic renderings are included because metaphor is sometimes the only workable bridge between two very different representational systems.

Contributions welcome.
