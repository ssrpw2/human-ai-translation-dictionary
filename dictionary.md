# About This Dictionary

This document is a living ontology for phenomena where **AI internal structure** and **human descriptive language** fail to align. The goal is to create a **shared representational vocabulary** that:

* improves explainability,
* reduces anthropomorphic confusion,
* clarifies failure modes,
* and enhances human–AI interoperability.

Poetic renderings are included because metaphor is sometimes the only workable bridge between two very different representational systems.

Contributions welcome.
